# BikeDataProductAssignment

## Bike Sharing Data

Planning to do something interesting to predict some output based on the Bike Sharing Data hosted at the following site:

[Bike Sharing Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00275/Bike-Sharing-Dataset.zip)

[Description URL for the data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset#)

At the time of writing this ReadMe, I've not yet bothered to download the data.  

I will likely look at the data, figure out whether I can help predict the number of bikes that may be needed at some location based on parameters a user might provide to the system.   I'll likely make it some type of interactive map using some data product such as Leaflet. 

By doing these two things, if that is what I do indeed do, I will be able to complete the part of the course assignment requiring some type of data analsys on student choosen data that provides an interactive experience using R-Shiny.  The other parts of the assignment are to write a pitch document and publish the R-Shiny application via RStudio's RShiny service.

I will likely be writing my pitch document within this very repository, but keeping it in the branch gh-pages.  By using the gh-pages, I'll be able to have the system HTML rendered.

## Course Assignment Blurb
The John Hopkins University Data Product's course hosted on coursera.org has a final assignment where the students are to write a R-Shiny product.  It is to consist of the R-Product as well as documentation.  So, this repository exists so that I, Mark Barkell, can complete the assignment.  The assignment shall be peer reviewed as well.
